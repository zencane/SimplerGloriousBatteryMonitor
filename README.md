## 🛠️ Building from Source

**Prerequisites**
- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
- Windows 10/11
- Git

**Commands**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rodrigo-200/GloriousBatteryMonitor-Go.git
cd GloriousBatteryMonitor-Go
dotnet restore
dotnet build --configuration Release
```

**Running tests**
```bash
dotnet test --verbosity normal
```

**Key dependencies**
- [HidSharp](https://github.com/IntergatedCircuits/HidSharp) – HID device communication
- [Velopack](https://github.com/velopack/velopack) – Auto-update framework

---

## 🔧 Technical Overview

**Architecture**
- **Language:** C# / .NET 8
- **HID layer:** HidSharp (multi-interface enumeration)
- **UI:** Windows system tray (WinForms)
- **Updates:** Velopack (GitHub releases backend)

**HID Probe Strategy (Pixart PAW3370 receiver)**

The app uses a waterfall of probe candidates to find battery data across device interfaces:

```
Candidate D  →  GetFeature sweep on col01 (FF00 vendor interface)
Candidate F  →  GetFeature on col01 + listen for response on col05 (cross-interface pattern)
Candidate A  →  SetFeature with battery request payload on col01
Candidate B  →  SetFeature with alternate payload on col01
Candidate E  →  Passive stream read on col05 (unsolicited reports)
```

---

## 🐞 Troubleshooting

### Device not detected / shows "Disconnected"

1. Check the debug log at `%APPDATA%\GloriousBatteryMonitor\debug.log`
2. Try unplugging and re-plugging the USB receiver
3. If your mouse model shows as "In Progress" in the supported devices table above, battery reading may not yet be implemented for it — check back in a future release

### Antivirus False Positives

Some antivirus software may flag the executable.  
✅ **Solution:** Whitelist the executable or report a false positive to your AV vendor.
